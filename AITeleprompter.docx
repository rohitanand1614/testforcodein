[Teleprompter Script: AI-Based Automation Test Implementation Flow]

Hello everyone,

Today, I’d like to walk you through the implementation flow I expect our team to adopt for automating test cases using AI. This will streamline our quality process and improve efficiency across releases.

Let’s begin with the overall process.

Step 1: Test Case Identification

We start by identifying test cases that are already present in qTest and have been marked as ready for testing.


Step 2: AI Test Case Generation

Our AI-powered tool will extract the test steps from qTest and automatically generate corresponding automation test scripts based on those steps.


Step 3: Merge Request Creation

Once the automation test cases are generated, the tool will automatically create a merge request in GitLab with the newly written tests.


Step 4: Manual Review

A reviewer will assess the generated test cases, check the code coverage, and perform a health check.

Based on this review, the MR will either be approved or rejected.


Step 5: Rejection Handling

If the test cases are rejected, the AI tool should apply the suggested changes, regenerate the test cases if required, and submit an updated merge request.


Step 6: Approval and Merge

Once the reviewer approves the MR, the test cases will be merged into the master branch.


Step 7: Impacted Area Validation

Our AI-based impacted area validation tool will now kick in.

It will include the newly added test cases and also identify additional test cases that may be impacted due to recent changes in the development code base or active Jira tickets.


Step 8: Test Suite Execution

The tool will organize the relevant test cases and execute subsets of the automation suite across different test environments.

This ensures comprehensive testing before code promotion.


The key objective here is to automate, validate, and scale our test coverage with minimal manual intervention, while still allowing room for human review where necessary.

Let’s aim to operationalize this flow in phases and regularly review progress to refine the pipeline.

Thanks, and I’m happy to take questions or suggestions from here.
