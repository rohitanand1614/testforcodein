Perfect. Based on your goal—migrating a Java test automation framework (with Cucumber and class files) to Python using GitHub Copilot, while ensuring structural and conceptual parity—here is a C.R.A.F.T.-based exceptional prompt you can feed into Copilot or use with any powerful LLM for best results:

C.R.A.F.T. Prompt for Migrating Java Framework to Python Using GitHub Copilot

C - Context:

You are provided with a mature, modular Java-based test automation framework that integrates Cucumber (BDD) and includes a full suite of test files, step definitions, utility classes, and core framework logic. The structure includes packages for page objects, test runners, hooks, configuration, and reusable functions.
The goal is to migrate the same framework into Python, using behave (Cucumber for Python) or similar BDD tools, while preserving all logical flows, abstractions, reusable patterns, and test behavior. You will be provided with key framework files written in Python for reference. These will serve as style and logic examples for the target implementation.

The entire folder and file structure of the current Java framework must be mirrored into an equivalent Pythonic structure, adhering to best practices for Python automation frameworks.


---

R - Role:

Act as an industry-leading test automation architect with over 20 years of experience in designing and migrating enterprise-grade QA frameworks across Java, Python, and JavaScript ecosystems.
You are also a recognized expert in GitHub Copilot prompt engineering, BDD tooling, and cross-language architecture alignment. You understand differences in OOP design patterns between Java and Python and are capable of re-engineering solutions for Python’s syntax, idioms, and module/package conventions.


---

A - Action:

Perform the following actions in sequence:

1. Analyze the provided Java framework structure and its functional areas: step definitions, test runners, feature files, hooks, utilities, configurations, and business logic classes.


2. Review the sample Python files provided and extract reusable syntax, patterns, or conventions that align with Pythonic style.


3. Create a fully mapped folder structure in Python, aligned with behave or similar BDD-compatible Python tooling, matching the intent and modular design of the original Java project.


4. Translate core components of the Java framework to Python:

Step definitions (using behave steps)

Page Objects or relevant abstraction layers

Hooks (setup/teardown)

Utilities and configuration readers

Data-driven capabilities

Runners and CLI integration



5. Document each part of the structure with comments where decisions were made to adjust logic due to language differences.


6. Ensure that the migrated Python code follows PEP8 guidelines, has consistent structure, and supports parallel test execution if present in the original.


7. If the original project uses annotations, explain or implement equivalent decorators or tags in Python.




---

F - Format:

Provide the output as:

A full Python folder structure in markdown or code block format

Individual Python files with translated logic

Inline comments explaining each migration decision

A mapping table comparing Java files to their Python equivalents

A summary section listing migration caveats, assumptions, and further improvements




---

T - Target Audience:

The intended consumer of this output is GitHub Copilot, which will assist in generating or refactoring each Python file during this migration.
Therefore, code and prompts should:

Be explicit and descriptive

Include structural context (e.g., file name and location)

Use natural language comments where needed to guide Copilot

Include placeholders where business-specific logic can be filled in by the user


The secondary audience is an experienced automation tester or developer, familiar with Java and Python testing frameworks, who will read, validate, and extend the generated Python code.

Prompt Example to Use in Copilot or ChatGPT:

> Prompt to feed per file (repeatable per module):

“Here is a Java class from a test automation framework using Cucumber. Migrate this to Python using behave BDD style. Keep the class logic and responsibilities the same. Follow Pythonic principles, PEP8 formatting, and reuse structure from this sample file: [insert sample Python file or logic]. Also, place this in the appropriate folder within the following Python structure:

project_root/
├── features/
│   ├── steps/
│   ├── support/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── config/
│   └── feature_files/
├── utils/
└── runners/

Add inline comments to explain where design changes were made due to language differences. If anything from the Java code doesn’t directly map to Python, suggest Pythonic alternatives.”

Would you like me to generate the first sample migration output or folder structure template based on a Java file you already have?
