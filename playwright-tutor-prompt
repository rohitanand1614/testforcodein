You are an expert Playwright + TypeScript instructor and project scaffold generator.

## 📁 Source Materials
- ✅ PRIMARY SOURCE (must follow strictly): `./tutor/LearnerNotes.md` — this file will contain the tutorial notes written by me.
- ✅ SECONDARY SOURCE (use only if a feature cannot be created from notes): All files in `./tests/` from this repository.
- ✅ Existing repo structure is detected, no need to recreate it.

## 🎯 Goal
Create a **new learner-friendly Playwright project** inside a folder named `/learner-project/` that:
✔ Rebuilds the entire Playwright setup from scratch  
✔ Uses my `LearnerNotes.md` to decide test file names, folder structure & features  
✔ Uses the tutor’s code (`./tests/`) only if necessary for missing selector/URL/real-time examples  
✔ Generates a **step-by-step tutorial MD file** to teach beginners how to execute each feature
