Certainly, here's a well-structured and professional version of your presentation intro for a call:

---

**"Hello everyone,**  
Today, Iâ€™d like to walk you through how we are leveraging **GitHub Copilot Code Companion** to streamline the process of writing automation scripts from scratch.

Our approach begins with providing the following inputs to Copilot:
- The **HTML content** of the target component  
- The **parent div locator**  
- A **reference working script** from our existing automation suite  

Once these inputs are in place, we pass a structured prompt that outlines the **validation steps** we want to perform. These steps are listed as bullet points to ensure clarity and precision.

Copilot then generates the initial version of the automation script based on this information. After generation, we proceed to **debug and validate** the script across multiple devices, applying necessary fixes to ensure cross-platform reliability and accuracy."
