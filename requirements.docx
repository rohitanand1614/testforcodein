# Requirement Specification Document for Combined UI and Visual Automation Tool

---

## Section 1: UI Automation

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-UI-01:** The tool must automatically fetch validation steps from manual test cases and generate automation scripts covering 100% of the defined manual steps.
* **FR-UI-02:** Generated automation scripts must be compatible across multiple browsers and devices, including but not limited to Chrome (Windows/Mac), Safari (Mac, iPhone), and other mobile devices.
* **FR-UI-03:** Generated scripts must comply with established coding standards and be performance-optimized to minimize execution time and maximize test coverage.
* **FR-UI-04:** The automation scripts generated should integrate seamlessly with the existing automation suite.
* **FR-UI-05:** Scripts must intelligently reuse existing framework utility methods by scanning the utility files and invoking reusable components wherever applicable.
* **FR-UI-06:** The tool should proactively detect and eliminate redundant code by automatically generating and updating reusable method instances in utility files.
* **FR-UI-07:** Generated tests should handle timezone and data variations resiliently, ensuring execution consistency regardless of market times, device locations, or local timezones.
* **FR-UI-08:** Tool-generated tests should achieve an initial pass rate between 80% to 90%, requiring minimal manual interventions.
* **FR-UI-09:** The tool must support GitLab-based manual review workflows, allowing automation testers to review, approve, reject, and comment on generated scripts. The tool must iteratively refine scripts based on these review outcomes.
* **FR-UI-10:** Support self-healing capabilities to proactively identify and correct script breakages, reducing script maintenance overhead significantly.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-UI-01:** The learning curve for the tool must be minimal, allowing testers to be onboarded quickly with productivity improvements of at least 50%.
* **NFR-UI-02:** Transparency in script generation steps must be maintained to enhance explainability and future maintainability.
* **NFR-UI-03:** The tool must comply with industry-standard security guidelines to safeguard scripts, execution data, and intellectual property.
* **NFR-UI-04:** The tool must be designed to support seamless version updates and future scalability, ensuring internal teams have access to detailed documentation for future enhancements and updates.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Scripts cover 100% steps from manual cases.
* Compatible execution on defined devices/browsers.
* Scripts pass standard code review practices.
* Demonstrated integration with the existing automation framework.
* Proven self-healing and reusable method identification.
* GitLab-based approval workflow operational.

### Success Metrics

* Minimum 80% to 90% initial script pass rate.
* At least 50% productivity improvement post-implementation.
* Reduction of manual intervention by 60%.

## Section 2: Visual Automation

### Functional Requirements

* **FR-VA-01:** The visual automation tool must handle dynamic content efficiently, including automatically adjusting for vertical and horizontal shifts.
* **FR-VA-02:** Must accurately validate element layouts without strict reliance on exact inner text matching.
* **FR-VA-03:** Baseline management and approval must be facilitated through the tool, including proactive self-healing capabilities to manage and reduce maintenance overhead.

### Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-VA-01:** Minimal learning curve ensuring testers rapidly onboard with at least 50% improvement in productivity.
* **NFR-VA-02:** Tool transparency for clear explainability and easy maintainability.
* **NFR-VA-03:** Adherence to strict security standards to secure visual assets, baselines, and metadata.
* **NFR-VA-04:** Seamless version control integration to facilitate straightforward updates and feature enhancements, with comprehensive internal documentation.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Reliable handling of dynamic content and layout shifts.
* Successful layout validation independent of textual content.
* Operational baseline and self-healing mechanisms demonstrated.

### Success Metrics

* Achieve at least 90% reliability in dynamic content validation.
* Productivity enhancement of minimum 50% post-implementation.
* Demonstrate a clear reduction in maintenance overhead by at least 60%.
