"Hi everyone, thanks for joining me today. I'm excited to show you a demo of our new GenAI-powered test case generation tool."
[5-20 seconds]

"Let's dive right in. The first step is providing the tool with the necessary context. We do this through relevant documents."
[20-45 seconds]

"First, we upload historical regression test cases. These are extracted from QTest and formatted in a specific way, which we've labeled with an 'HT' suffix. This gives the AI a baseline of existing tests."
[45-75 seconds]

"Secondly, we upload a DPD file. This is where we provide project or story-specific data. Since our Jira tickets are our source of truth, the DPD file includes a placeholder for the Jira ticket content. We simply copy and paste the relevant information. Additionally, this document has a 'Resource' section. Here, we can attach any supplementary files from the Jira ticket, such as design documents or screenshots, to give the LLM a more complete picture."
[75-95 seconds]

"Finally, within the DPD file, we have a section for 'Additional Information.' This is where testers can add any unique insights or context that might be helpful. If nothing else is needed, we simply leave it blank."
[95-110 seconds]

"Once we've uploaded these two documents, we're ready to start a conversation with the tool and generate our test cases."
[110-135 seconds]

"To prompt the AI, we've created a standardized format. It's designed to be user-friendly, with a placeholder for the story ID, epic ID, or project name. The rest of the prompt is kept generic, making it easy to use across different projects."
[135-155 seconds]

"Now, when we input this prompt, the GenAI skill generates test cases in a well-structured and organized format. You'll see how it interprets the information from our documents and creates relevant tests."
[155-175 seconds]

"Importantly, the generated test cases are thoroughly reviewed by our team of testers. We've found that the AI's output is consistently appropriate, with an average rating of 4 out of 5. This confirms the tool's effectiveness and reliability."
[175-185 seconds]

"And that concludes our demo. Thank you for your time and attention. We're excited about the potential of this tool to streamline our testing process."
(End with a friendly smile and a nod.)
